# Language Translation from image using Pytesseract 

This project presents a novel approach to language translation using Pytesseract which acts as an optical character recognition and google translate. The purpose is to develop an accurate and convenient method to translate different languages from different sources - road signs, texts, food menu using python code. With the advancement of programming languages and apis, this program has been successfully built using Google Colab as it’s platform and python language as it’s main source code to extract texts from different images and languages to English. This program successfully translates 4 different images in terms of languages and sources into english. This program is capable to translate more than 50 languages using Pytesseract and google translate.
